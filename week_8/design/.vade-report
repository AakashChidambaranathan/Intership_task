Implementation Details:
======================
The SpeedInsights component was added inside the main App component's JSX return statement, 
positioned after the Router element to ensure it properly tracks all performance metrics 
across the entire application. This placement allows Vercel Speed Insights to monitor 
performance across all routes defined in the application.

The component requires no props and will automatically collect performance metrics and 
send them to Vercel for analysis.
